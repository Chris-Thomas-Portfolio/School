	ls: this command lists the files in the directory. You can use -l to get the
		the long version of the information. You can use the -a to not ignore hidden
		files.

Question 8:
	Physical memory is the physical memory that the machine has IE RAM.

	text "is a var" after it to the screen.
	echo '$VAR is a var' will print out the text "$VAR is a var" to the screen.

Question 10:
	Threads share memory and can easily communicate with each other.
	Processes have their own memory and are more difficult to communicate with

Question 12:
	On success the PID of the child process is returnedin the parent and 0 is returned

Question 18:
	This would be a memory leak. You want to use valgrind to try and find it.

Question 19:
	CFLAGS = -Wall -g -O0 -c

	OBJS = prog.o \

	CC = gcc

	all: exe

	exe: $(OBJS)
			gcc $(OBJS) -o exe -g

	clean:
			rm -f $(OBJS)
			rm exe

	prog.o: prog.c this.h that.h

Question 20:
